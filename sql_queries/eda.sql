     ##Deleted the first 10 rows to fix error in code
       delete from profit_margins
       where segment is null or avg_discount is null;
    ## Avg-discount column was not included when the table was created. I altered the table to add the column. But it was showing the values in new rows where the values of other columns were showing null. Hence deleted the first 10 rows

select * from profit_margins;
